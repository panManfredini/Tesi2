\chapter{Prospects for Neutral MSSM Higgs Search Improvement}

The neutral MSSM Higgs search, described in the previous chapter, 
suffers strongly of poor jet reconstruction efficiency and  b-tagging performance due to the particular phase space
required, this bound the potential of this search, improoving b-tagging
would result in a major improvement of the search sensitivity. 
This chapter investigates an alternative to the commonly used calorimeter jets in ATLAS, 
which is trackjets b-tagging. 
The prospects for successfully use trackjets b-tagging in the future neutral MSSM Higgs searches are reported,
b-tagging on trackjets was never attempted before.
Section\ref{bla} describes this and that...

\section{Introduction to Trackjets}
% reasonable intro + ++ 
This problematic has two sources:
- The ATLAS calorimeter is not a sampling calorimeter, this means that responses differently 
for Hadrons and for leptons, has different responses to electromagnetic and hadronic shower.
The Calorimeter cells are calibrated in energy using response to electromagnetic showers, to 
know the energy of the original parton that initiated the jet there are different procedure 
to calibrate the Jets offline which are called in short Jet Energy Scale (JES) corrections \cite{}, 
which make use of MC simulation.
Due to the high amount of pileup and ambient energy density in the events, jets are calibrated % also other problems: underlying event ecc..
from 20 GeV in $\pt$, this means that currently is not possible with calorimeter jets to access the
low transverse momentum phase space.

\end{figure}

The neutral MSSM Higgs search, as described in chapter~\ref{chap:anal}, splits the dataset in two category
by means of the presence or the absence of a b-tagged jet, the b-tagged category is optimized for the b-associated production 
mechanism, in which the Higgs is produced in association with two b-jets. Figure~\ref{fig:bjetDistro} shows a comparison 
between $\pt$ spectrum of simulated b-hadron in b-associated Higgs  and $\ttbar$ events, the signal prefers b-hadron with 
relatively low transverse momentum,  jet calibration invoqe jet $\pt > 20$ GeV removing a large fraction of possible
signal candidate, many of the b-associated production signal events falls in fact in the b-veto category, making 
the separation not so effective.
The low $\pt$ spectrum is actually quite challenging, jet reconstruction efficiency and calibration set then a lower limit
to the signal sensitivity in the b-tag category.
Another challenge to this search are the poor b-tagging performance at low transverse momentum, for the a fixed tagging point of the 
MV1 tagger the b-tagging efficiency drops, in fact,  rapidly  with jet $\pt$ reacing a minimum of 50\% at 20 GeV \cite{BtaggingScaleFactors,BtaggingScaleFactorsNew}
(using as tagging point the 70\% point).

A solution to the jet reconstruction efficiency is to use, instead of calorimetric jets (calo-jet), track-jet , which are as well
anti-kt object (see chapter\ref{chap:detector}) but constructed using inner detector tracks as building blocks, not calorimeter cells.
Jets in the ATLAS reconstruction software are reconstructed by clustering four vector objects (calorimeter energy cluster, tracks, 
truth particle, etc.) in the $\eta - \phi$ plane. In the case of clustering tracks, however, it is possible to take advantege of
the longitudinal (\emph{z}) impact parameter information provided by the inner detector and build track-jets in three dimensions 
$\eta - \phi - z$. Track-jets will then contains only tracks originating from the same interaction point (reconstructed vertex).
Even thoug for calorimeter jet is possible to use the JVF, track-jets result to be more resistant to decrease in performance in the
presence of pile-up, thus particolarly important in b-tagging, which depends on the determination of the jet-axis. 
B-tagging has been never tested before on track-jets, in the following, the first study of b-tagging over track-jets 
performances is reported. 

%%%%%% Definition of Trackjets %%%%%%%%%%%
Trackjets are builded by running the anti-kt clustering algorithm on a subset of tracks with respect to
the total tracks in the event, this subsample is chosen by means of the TrackZTool this will return only
tracks that are associated with the primary vertex of the event (vertex with higher transverse momentum 
tracks associated), furthermore, to be allowed in the collection, tracks need to pass the following 
quality selection criteria:
\begin{itemize}
\item $|z_{PV} * sin(\theta)| < 1.5$ mm, which the distance between the primary vertex and
the extrapolation of the track to the plane ortogonal to the beam axis, and is a measure of how 
much the track is pointing to the PV in the plane that contain the beam axis.
\item $d_{PV} < 1.5$ mm where $d$ is the minimum distance between the track and the primary vertex  
in the plane ortogonal to the beam axis.
\item At least one pixel hit and at least 5 SCT hits.
\item No b-layer hit requiremets
\item $|\eta| < 2.5$
\item $\pt > 300 $ MeV
\item To build a trackjets is necessary to cluster at least two tracks
\item A trackjet is produced and stored if the sum of its tracks has $\pt > 2$ GeV.
\end{itemize}
it has been shown that those selections, togheter with a maximum cone size for clustering of 
$\Delta R = 0.6$, are the best compromise between quality requirements, to control "fakes" i.e. 
tracks from random association of hits or badly reconstructed tracks, and b-hadron reconstruction efficiency.

%%%%%%% Definition of the Samples %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
For the purpose of studying performance of trackjets the trackject building algorithm, with the 
specifications previously described, the following ATLAS standard MC simulation samples are produced
with trackjets and b-tagging by means of ad-hoc implemented software within the ATLAS NTUPLE
production software framework. Table~\ref{tab:tackjetSample} report a summary of the produced samples
and their purpose of use.

%\subsection{Motivation}
%\subsection{Definition of Trackjet}
\section{Trackjet Performance}
\subsection{B-tagging Performance}
Many analysis could profit from an enhanced b-jet reconstruction efficiency at low $\pt$, 
the study presented in this section is aimed to compare performance of common 
b-tagging algorithm and b-jet reconstruction efficiency between calorimeter jets (calo-jet)
and track-jets, the study is specially focused on low transverse momentum jets.
Due to the high precision of the inner detector track-jets are robust agaist 
pileup and is possible possible to reconstruct them up to very low transverse momentum,
if they are used for the only purpose of b-tagging then calibration is also not needed,
however, track-jets can only reconstruct the charged part of the jet, the neutral part is lost,
according to isospin invariance the expected neutral fraction in a jet is roughly $2/3$ of the total.
This implies that the momentum and  of the track-jet will be shifted and the direction will 
have a larger uncertainty, figure~\ref{fig:residuals} shows a comparison of track-jet and calo-jet $\pt$ residuals 
with respect to true jet $\pt$, this effect may be critical for b-tagging algorithm since some of them
strongly rely on the maesurement of jet axis and jet $\pt$.

\begin{figure}[tp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figure/trackjet/residuals.pdf}
\caption{Residuals comparison of track-jet and calo-jet $\pt$ with respect simulated jet $\pt$.}
\label{fig:residuals}
\end{figure}    

To compare performance of track-jet and calo-jet, a cone size anti-kt 0.4 is choosen,
if a reconstructed jets lais up to a distance in $\Delta R $ < 0.3 from a simulated b-hadron
in the event, this jet is said to \emph{match with a b-hadron}. 
Reconstruction efficiency is then defined as the ratio between the number of matched b-hadron
and the total number of b-hadron. Figure~\ref{fig:recoEff} compare b-hadron reconstruction efficiency
between calo-jet and track-jets, the latter shows a higher reconstruction efficiency for low 
transverse momentum due to their robustness to pileup.
\begin{figure}[tp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figure/trackjet/recoEfficiency.pdf}
\caption{Comparison of b-hadron reconstruction efficiency for track-jet and calo-jet as a 
function of the simulated b-hadron $\pt$. Note that calo-jet and track-jet has a requirement 
at production level to be respectively with $\pt > 7$ and 2 GeV, a fair comparison is only possible
above 8 GeV in $\pt$.}
\label{fig:recoEff}
\end{figure}    

To exploit the performance of b-tagging on trackjets other two definitions are usefull: the tagging
efficiency and the rejection power. The \emph{tagging efficiency} is the fraction of \emph{matched} jets 
wich passes a determined selection on a tagging algorithm, i.e. which are \emph{tagged}.
The rejection is the inverse of the misidentifying rate, i.e. the inverse of the fraction 
of the jets which are not matched with a b-hadron or c-hadron, but are tagged. Fixing the selection
value for a given tagging algorithm will fix a point in the efficiency-rejection plane, this
is a common way in ATLAS to determine the performance of b-tagging and is shown in figure~\ref{fig:eff_rej},
figure~\ref{fig:rej_pt} instead shows the rejection as a function of the $\pt$ of the trackjet for the
tagging point which gives 50\% efficiency for that $\pt$ value. Mistagging rate is rapidly increasing
for low transverse momentum trackjets, revealing the necessity of a dedicated tagging algorithm for 
low $\pt$ jets.

	tagging point which gives 50\% efficiency for that $\pt$ value. Different ATLAS tagging algorithm 
	are reported.}
\label{fig:rej_pt}
\end{figure}    

The previously introduced definitions do not allow a fair comparison between trackjets 
and calojets, due to the fact that calojets can be reconstructed also in case
no tracks are associated with them, in this particular case any tagging algorithm would likely fail,
altering the rejection distribution. It is convinient to use instead the following quantities,
\emph{effective rejection}, which is the inverse of the number of mistagged jets per event, and the
b-hadron \emph{reconstruction efficiency}, which is defined above. Figure~\ref{fig:cj_tj} shows 
a comparison between calojets and trackjets for the two variables just defined, for a given 
b-hadron reconstruction efficiency  trackjets can achieve higher rejection, for a fair 
comparison in this plot trackjets are selected in the transverse momentum range between 4 and 25 GeV, while
calojets between 8 and 50 GeV, this follow from figure~\ref{fig:residuals}. This demonstrates that 
thackjets are more suitable than calojets for low transverse momentum b-tagging.

%\subsection{Impact of Trackjet to the Analysis} % A new Hope
The impact of trackjets on the analysis is tested in a preliminary study, the yield of 
signal and for the most significant backgrounds is compared in table~\ref{tab:tj_cj},
where preselection is defined in a very similar\footnote{This study has not been updated 
with the newest version of the object reconstruction selections and corrections, a difference of the order of 10\%
is expected with respect the numbers in table~\ref{tab:eventsel:btag}.} 
way to what has been discuss in section~\ref{sec:topology} with the following exeption 
on the definition of taggable jets:
\begin{itemize}
\item Calorimeter taggable jets should have $|\eta| < 2.5$ and $20 < \pt < 50$ GeV
\item Track taggable jets should have $|\eta| < 2.5$ and $5 < \pt < 33$ GeV, this correspond to the same
  	range as for calojets above, figure~\ref{fig:residuals} in fact is only valid for low $\pt$ jets
	and the fraction of momentum lost approciate 1/3 for high $\pt$ trackjets. 
\end{itemize}
