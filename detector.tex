\chapter{The ATLAS Detector, Physics Object Reconstruction and Performance}\label{chap:detector}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  questa parte va nel detector chapter %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%This problematic has two sources:
%- The ATLAS calorimeter is not a sampling calorimeter, this means that responses differently 
%for Hadrons and for leptons, has different responses to electromagnetic and hadronic shower.
%The Calorimeter cells are calibrated in energy using response to electromagnetic showers, to 
%know the energy of the original parton that initiated the jet there are different procedure 
%to calibrate the Jets offline which are called in short Jet Energy Scale (JES) corrections \cite{}, 
%which make use of MC simulation.
