A search for neutral MSSM Higgs bosons A, h, H with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented based on proton-proton collisions data at a center-of-mass energy of 8 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20 fb−1. The searched is performed for Higgs decays into τ lepton pairs and subsequet decay via .
