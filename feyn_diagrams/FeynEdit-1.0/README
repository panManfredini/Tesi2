This is FeynEdit, a graphical editor for Feynman diagrams.
It is quite similar to the FeynArts topology editor and also 
uses FeynArts' LaTeX format for the diagrams.

The program is independent of FeynArts, however, i.e. one
does not need to start from diagrams generated by FeynArts.

The program is written in Java and should thus run on almost
any platform.

The following files are included in this package:

FeynEdit.pdf		-- the manual

FeynEdit.jar		-- the compiled Java code

makefile		-- the makefile

			-- the source files
Manifest.txt		   the Manifest for the jar file
de/feynarts/*		   the source files of the editor itself
de/feynarts/icons/*	   the icons used by the editor
jakarta-regexp-1.5/*	   the Jakarta-Regexp code

The Java bytecode is contained in the file FeynEdit.jar.
Users in a Unixish programming environment may want to run
"make" after unpacking the tar file, which produces an executable 
FeynEdit that can be invoked directly from the command line.  
Alternately, the bytecode can explicitly be run with
"java -jar FeynEdit.jar".

Windows and Mac users usually do not need this step, as they 
can simply double-click FeynEdit.jar. 

Note 1: If you get a message from the Java interpreter that
your Java version is too old to execute this code, either
upgrade to a more recent version (java.com), or rename
FeynEdit.jar and type "make" to compile FeynEdit.jar anew
with your installed Java version.

Note 2: A number of (mostly Debian-derived) Linux distributions
seem to have gij (GNU's Java interpreter) installed instead of
the original Sun Java Runtime Environment (JRE).  This leads to
error messages like "Failed to load Main-Class manifest attribute"
when invoking FeynEdit.  The problems originate from gij rather
than FeynEdit.  The solution is to install Sun's original JRE
from java.com.

The source code consists of the jar-file Manifest (Manifest.txt),
the class files for the editor (de/feynarts/*) and the Jakarta
Regexp code (jakarta-regexp-1.5/*).  Jakarta-Regexp is a regular-
expression parser and part of the Apache Jakarta project
(http://jakarta.apache.org).  Note that the name de/feynarts/* 
follows standard Java conventions (package name starts with reverse
of domain name) and does not imply that the FeynArts source code
is needed to run FeynEdit.


Enjoy!
