\section{Background Prediction and Validation}
\label{sec:BackgroundEstimation}

This section describes the strategies for  the prediction of the background contributions and validation of these predictions.
Monte Carlo  simulation is extensively used to model the kinematic properties of the background and signal processes.
However, since the  simulation of any process is usually prone to systematic
uncertainties due to a non-perfect description of the pileup effects,
underlying event and detector performance, the background contributions from 
$\Ztautau$ and QCD multi-jet process are estimated using dedicated signal-free control data samples, 
as described respectively in section~\ref{sec:ztau} and~\ref{sec:qcd}.
%estimate backgrounds from data. In particular for the following cases:
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item[$\bullet$] The $Z \rightarrow \tau\tau \rightarrow ll ~ + ~  4\nu$ is estimated from data using the embedding technique described in Section~\ref{sec:data_mc}.
%  \item[$\bullet$] The multi-jet background is estimated completely from data using the so-called ABCD method.   
%\end{itemize}
Contributions of other background processes, such as \ttbar, single top quark, dibosons, $Z
\rightarrow ll$ + jets (where $l = e,\mu$) and W + jets, are estimated
from simulation. Given the relatively large \ttbar background contribution, a dedicated study to validate
this background prediction has been made as described in section~\ref{sec:top_est}.

A good agreement between data and background prediction is found after the common selection, as can be seen in 
Figure~\ref{fig:selections} and Figure~\ref{fig:validation}.

\subsection{Validation of the \ttbar Background Prediction}
\label{sec:top_est}

The background contribution from top quark pair production is estimated using a sample of simulated events generated with POWHEG-PYTHIA Monte Carlo
generator. Since this is one of the major background processes for the presented analysis a careful validation 
of the predicted contribution is needed. For this purpose
signal-depleted data validation sample  enriched with \ttbar events  by requiring the presence of exactly two b-tagged jets in all the events
passing the common selection.
%Since this is one of the major backgrounds for this analysis (especially in b-tag category)
%a careful validation of this background model is need, for this purpose a  top quark enriched control region (CR)  
%is defined by adding to the preselection the further requirement of exactly two b-tagged jets in the event. 
Figures~\ref{fig:kinematicsttbar} and~\ref{fig:cutsttbar} show the distributions for a set of kinematic properties and all discriminating 
variables obtained with this  data sample. Good agreement between data and Monte Carlo prediction is found with 
%and shows that our top-quark background model describes well the data
%Also the prediction of the event yield in this CR is in good agreement with data: 
overall ratio of the observed to the predicted number of \ttbar events of $0.998 \pm 0.011\mathrm{(stat.)} \pm 0.110 \mathrm{(sys.)}\,.$
The total systematic uncertainty on the ratio is dominated by the uncertainty of the b-tagging efficiency. 
%In addition, this result could be used
%as a measure of $t\bar{t}$ normalization avoiding systematic uncertainty on the theoretical cross section of
%this process. In this case, however, additional acceptance systematics would need to be evaluated in a dedicated study.
%
%with a dedicated RIVET analysis and uncertainties of the order of the cross section 
%uncertainty are expected, we then drop this possibility considering that wont bring  
%significant improvements.

\subsection{Multi-jet Background Measurement}
\label{sec:qcd}

The QCD multi-jet process represents an important background, 
especially in the b-vetoed event category, due to its high cross-section and the 
relatively low threshold on the lepton \pt used in this analysis. The contribution of this
background is evaluated by the so-called ABCD data-driven technique.
The ABCD method splits the sample of data events after the common selection into four sub-samples: the
signal sample (A), defined by the event selections criteria described in Section~\ref{sec:selection}
and three signal-depleted control data sample (B,C,D), which are orthogonal to each other  and are
enriched in multi-jets events. The three control data samples are defined by inverting the requirements on the relative 
sign of the electron and muon charge  and  on the isolation criteria. 
Both the calorimetric and tracking isolation criteria described in Section~\ref{sec:presel}  are inverted for each electron and muon 
with respect to the nominal values, thus defining the so-called anti-isolated leptons. 
The data are divided into four samples of events with leptons of opposite sign charge (OS) 
or same sign charge (SS) with respectively isolated or anti-isolated leptons, as summarized in Table~\ref{table:qcd}.

\begin{table} [tp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c c c }
\hline
Data Sample & Relative Lepton Charge & Lepton Isolation \\ [0.5ex]
\hline
A (signal sample) & OS & isolated \\
\hline
B & SS & isolated \\
C & OS & anti-isolated \\
D & SS & anti-isolated \\ [1ex]
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Control data samples for the measurement of the QCD multi-jet background contribution. The samples are defined by the requirements on the relative
	charge sign of the two leptons (OS,SS) and the isolation criteria applied on them (isolated or anti-isolated). See text.}
\label{table:qcd}
\end{table}

The ABCD method assumes that there is no correlation between the relative 
charge and lepton isolation in QCD multi-jet events, or in other words that the ratio of OS/SS events is uncorrelated 
with the lepton isolation criteria. In this case, the number ($N_{A}$) of QCD multi-jet events in the signal sample $A$ 
can be estimated from the yields ($N_B$, $N_C$, $N_D$)  of multi-jet events in the control samples $B$, $C$ and $D$, using the equation
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:qcdest}
N_{A}  = N_{B} \times \frac{N_{C}}{N_{D}} =  N_{B} \times \rqcd
\end{equation}
%Here is  assumed that the events in the control samples come solely from QCD multi-jet processes, contamination
%from electroweak (W and Z + jets, dibosons) and top processes
%($t\bar{t}$ and single top production) are  subtracted in each control sample 
%using the MC prediction for their event yield.  
To obtain the pure QCD multi-jet event yields in the data control samples, the contribution 
from contaminating electroweak (W+jets, Z+jets and dibosons) and top quark processes
($t\bar{t}$,  single top quark production) is  subtracted in each control sample based 
on the prediction from simulation.
Tables~\ref{table:qcd_yield_btag}~and~\ref{table:qcd_yield_bveto}
show the observed event yield in each control sample at different stages of the event selection along with the
predictions of non-QCD background contributions  which are subtracted.
Signal contamination has been evaluated in all  three control samples for different 
mass points. For the range of $m_{A}$ and $\mathrm{tan}\beta$ considered in this analysis, the highest signal contamination 
is seen in sample B for the mass point $m_{A} = 300$ GeV and $\mathrm{tan}\beta = 50$, where  a contamination 
of 0.2\% is observed\footnote
{
This value is mainly due to b-associated production and,
as it scales with the cross section, for $\mathrm{tan}\beta = 20$ would be an order of magnitude smaller.
}.

Shapes of kinematic distributions for QCD events are taken from 
sample B, this sample is expected to have similar kinematic property to the signal sample, however, suffers of either lower statistics 
and higher contamination with respect to sample C or D.
This choice is made to avoid a shape bias due to isolation requirements at trigger level (only the single-electron trigger ask for isolation),
%the trigger:  an isolated trigger is used 
%for electrons (as described in Section~\ref{sec:eventsel}), where the offline requirement equivalent to this trigger choice is $\ptcone20/\pt <0.1$.
figure~\ref{fig:BvsD} shows the comparison between the electron $\pt$ distributions in sample B and D, 
in the latter high $\pt$ electrons are suppressed, they do not pass trigger selections. 
Eventually the trigger isolation requirement could
bias also the ratio OS/SS, this possibility has been checked carefully
in a dedicated study and reported in Appendix \ref{appendix:qcd}:
to a good approximation, such trigger effects cancel out in the ratio
OS/SS and no additional systematic is needed.

To test the ABCD method predictions an additional control sample has been defined with the following selections:
\begin{itemize}
\item \MET $< 20$ GeV
\item \Ht $< 70$ GeV and \SumLtMET$ < 50$ GeV
\item $0 < \mmc < 80$ GeV  	 
\end{itemize}
This control sample is designed to enhance multi-jet background with respect to \Ztautau keeping the final 
state kinematics as similar as possible to the signal sample.
Figure~\ref{fig:ABCD_cr} shows the \mmc distribution for this control sample with and without b-tagging requirements, 
agreement between data and the background model is found within statistical and detector related systematics uncertainty.

\subsection{$Z \rightarrow \tau\tau$ + Jets Background: Embedding Technique}\label{sec:ztau}
The background from \Ztautau decays is the major background to this analysis, a good understanding 
of it is then crucial.
 Unfortunately, for a light Higgs boson, it is impossible to completely separate \Ztautau decays 
from the signal and a signal free data control sample cannot be defined.
However, thanks to the small Higgs coupling to muons, \Zmumu decays provide a good starting point to 
model \Ztautau events in a data-driven way. An hybrid Data-MC sample, known as "Embedding" is used to model the \Ztautau background: 
$\Zmumu$ candidates are selected in data, then, the two muons from the $Z$ decay are substituted with the decay 
products from simulated taus, this means that the energy deposit and tracks in a cone around the muon are subtracted
and substituted with the one from $\tau$ decay, those taus have the same kinematics as the original muons. 
Further details on this technique may be found in \cite{Embedding, SMold}.

%The selection of the \Zmumu input data requires exactly two combined, opposite charged
%muons, where the leading muon has a transverse momentum $\pt > 20 \GeV$ and 
%the sub-leading muon $\pt > 15\GeV$. Both muons are requited to lie within $|\eta|<2.5$ and to be isolated with 
%$\ptcone 20/\pt<0.2$ (see Section~\ref{sec:presel}). Additionally 
%the invariant mass of the two muons is required to be in the range $M_{\mu\mu} > 40$ GeV.
%Once the muon pair events are selected, all tracks and calorimeter cells associated to the muons are 
%removed from the \Zmumu data event. Finally, the calorimeter cell energy and tracks from the simulated tau decays
%are added to the data event and the event is re-reconstructed.

%A set of corrections are applied to correct for the muon trigger efficiency, the muon reconstruction efficiency and other additional effects
%related to the original \Zmumu events. Finally, as the trigger is not emulated in the embedding sample, 
%an additional correction is applied to emulate the electron and muon trigger efficiencies in the final \Ztautau embedded events. 
%For a full description of the corrections and validation see \cite{SMnew}.

%The Embedding technique, which uses \Zmumu decays to 
%model \Ztautau events in a data-driven way, is described in Section~\ref{sec:data_mc}. 
Trigger is not simulated in the Embedding samples, the event yield
is normalized to ALPGEN \Ztautau at common selection stage. Furthermore a set of corrections, as described in \cite{SMnew}, are
applied to unfold from the original \Zmumu trigger and reconstruction efficiency, then trigger and reconstruction efficiency 
for a $e-\mu$ final state are emulated by means of event weight.

The Embedding technique has been validated in several studies, detailed in~\cite{Embedding, SMnew}, which show a good description of 
data and \Ztautau MC by Embedding. In the context of this analysis, 
figures~\ref{fig:emb_vs_alp1} and \ref{fig:emb_vs_alp} show comparisons of various kinematic variables between
data, Embedding and ALPGEN \Ztautau simulated events at common selection. No significant deviation is seen 
between the \mmc distribution of the Embedding and ALPGEN samples, 
however other relevant variables for this analysis, such as the \MET 
and the number of b-jets, are slightly better described by Embedding.

The Embedding sample is based on selecting \Zmumu candidates in data, the selections assure a rather 
pure \Zmumu sample, however further selections used in this analysis, for example the b-tagging requirements, 
could enhance the contamination fraction from other processes. Dedicated studies have been
made to estimate the $t\bar{t}$ and QCD multi-jet contamination in the Embedding sample.
The \ttbar~ contamination is estimated by evaluating the Embedding yield in a two b-tag control sample
(as described in Section~\ref{sec:top_est}), these events are assumed to be solely from $t\bar{t}$
and their yield in the signal sample is extrapolated using MC simulation.
Table~\ref{table:emb_cont_tt} shows a summary for the top contamination in Embedding. 
The multi-jet contamination can be estimated starting 
from the Embedding yield in (ABCD) sample C,
%one should not use SS samples because embedding already requires leptons to be OS, then would be biased
assuming all events in this control sample as QCD multi-jet events, the contamination in the signal sample 
can be estimated by means of the ABCD method (see Section~\ref{sec:qcd}). The \rqcd factor, in this case, 
is evaluated using a $\mu-\mu$ final state with same kinematic selections as for Embedding \Zmumu candidate.
Table~\ref{table:emb_cont_qcd}
shows the estimated contamination of QCD multi-jet in Embedding. 
Contamination effects are considered negligible.

\caption{Evaluating Embedding contamination due to QCD multi-jet using ABCD method, 
the control sample here is with OS anti-isolated events (sample C). The transfer factor is the
multiplicative factor that allows to estimate events in signal sample from the control sample, in this case is $N_{B} / N_{D}$
and is evaluated using mu-mu final state with the same kinematic selection used in the 
definition of the Embedding sample. }
