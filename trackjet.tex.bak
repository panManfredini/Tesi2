\chapter{Prospects for Neutral MSSM Higgs Search Improvement}

The neutral MSSM Higgs boson search, described in the previous chapter, 
suffers strongly of poor b-tagging performance due to the particular phase space
required, this bound the potential of this search, improving b-tagging
would result in a major improvement of the search sensitivity. 
This chapter investigates an alternative to the commonly used calorimeter jets in ATLAS, 
which is trackjets b-tagging. 
The prospects for successfully use trackjets b-tagging in the future neutral MSSM Higgs boson search are reported,
b-tagging on trackjets was never attempted before.
In section~\ref{sec:tj_intro} an introduction to the b-tagging challenges of the analysis and to trackjets is given.
Section~\ref{sec:tj_perf} presents trackjets performance on b-tagging in comparison with calorimeter jets, 
preliminary results on the impact of trackjets to the analysis are also described here. Finally, in section~\ref{sec:trackjetsys}
an evaluation of trackjets systematic uncertainties is presented.

   \label{fig:bjetDistro}
\end{figure}

The neutral MSSM Higgs search, as described in chapter~\ref{chap:anal}, splits the dataset in two category
by means of the presence or the absence of a b-tagged jet, the b-tagged category is optimized for the b-associated production 
mechanism, in which the Higgs is produced in association with two b-jets. Figure~\ref{fig:bjetDistro} shows a comparison 
between the $\pt$ spectrum of simulated b-hadron in $bb/A/h/H$ production  and $\ttbar$ events, the signal prefers b-hadron with 
relatively low transverse momentum, which is actually the major challenge for the b-tag category.
Due to the high amount of pileup and ambient energy density in the events, 
calorimeter jets are not calibrated below 20 GeV in $\pt$ (see chapter~\ref{chap:detector}), 
systematic uncertainties and performance are also not evaluated below this threshold, this means 
that, currently, the low transverse momentum phase space is not accessible to canonical calorimeter jets
(\emph{calojets} in the following). Calojets are then inconvenient for $bb/A/h/H$ production 
and  one of the major reason for sensitivity lost in the b-tag category.
%The low $\pt$ spectrum is actually quite challenging, jet reconstruction efficiency and calibration set then a lower limit
%to the signal sensitivity in the b-tag category.
Another challenge to this search is the drop in b-tagging performance at low transverse momentum, 
the MV1 tagger (see chapter~\ref{chap:detector}) efficiency , in fact, decreases  rapidly  with jet $\pt$, reaching a minimum of 50\% at 
20~GeV~\cite{BtaggingScaleFactors,BtaggingScaleFactorsNew} (using the tagging point with 70\% efficiency).

A solution to access jets with low transverse momentum in to use \emph{trackjets} instead of calojets.
Trackjets are anti-kt jets (see chapter\ref{chap:detector}) reconstructed  by clustering inner detector tracks, 
%not calorimeter cells.
%Jets in the ATLAS reconstruction software are reconstructed by clustering four vector objects (calorimeter energy cluster, tracks, 
%truth particle, etc.) in the $\eta - \phi$ plane. 
for them it is possible to take advantage of
the tracks longitudinal (\emph{z}) impact parameter information and build trackjets in three dimensions 
$\eta - \phi - z$. Trackjets will then contains only tracks originating from the same interaction point (reconstructed vertex),
this feature make them very robust with respect to pileup.
%thus particularly important in b-tagging, which depends on the determination of the jet-axis. 
B-tagging has never been tested before on trackjets, in section~\ref{sec:tj_perf} the first study of b-tagging over trackjets 
performances is reported. 

%%%%%% Definition of Trackjets %%%%%%%%%%%
Trackjets are builded  in the ATLAS reconstruction software by the \emph{TrackZTool},
this runs the anti-kt clustering algorithm on a subset of tracks which can be defined by the user.
For the purposes of this thesis trackjets are reconstructed  out of tracks that passes the following
quality selection criteria:
\begin{itemize}
\item $|z_{track} - z_{PV}| < 2$ mm, The track should be associated to the primary vertex (PV).
 
\item $|z_{PV} * sin(\theta)| < 1.5$ mm, which is
% the distance between the primary vertex and
%the extrapolation of the track to the plane orthogonal to the beam axis, and is 
a measure of how much the track is pointing to the PV in the plane that contain the beam axis.

\item $d_{PV} < 1.5$ mm, where $d_{PV}$ is the distance of minimum approach of the track to the  primary vertex  
in the plane orthogonal to the beam axis.


\item At least one pixel hit and at least 6 SCT hits (including SCT holes).

\item At least one b-layer hit if expected (i.e. the module passed by the track was active).

\item $|\eta| < 2.5$

\item $\pt > 300 $ MeV

\item To build a trackjets is necessary to cluster at least two tracks

\item A trackjet is produced and stored if the sum of its tracks has $\pt > 2$ GeV.
\end{itemize}
it has been shown that those selections, together with a maximum cone size for clustering of 
$\Delta R = 0.6$, are the best compromise between quality requirements, aimed 
to control fake tracks, and b-hadron reconstruction efficiency.
%to control "fakes" i.e. 
%tracks from random association of hits or badly reconstructed tracks, and b-hadron reconstruction efficiency.
%%%%%%% Definition of the Samples %%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Several MC simulation samples has been produced with the purpose of studying trackjets performance,
trackjets were reconstructed and b-tagged using an ad-hoc implementation of the TrackZTool within
the ATLAS software framework, table~\ref{tab:tackjetSample} reports a summary of the produced samples
along with their usage in this thesis.

%\subsection{Motivation}
%\subsection{Definition of Trackjet}
\section{Trackjet Performance} \label{sec:tj_perf}
%\subsection{B-tagging Performance}
Many analysis could profit from an enhanced b-jet reconstruction efficiency at low $\pt$, 
the studies presented in this section are aimed to compare performance of common 
b-tagging algorithm and b-jet reconstruction efficiency between calojets
and trackjets, these studies are specially focused on low transverse momentum.
%Due to the high precision of the inner detector trackjets are robust against 
%pileup and is possible possible to reconstruct them up to very low transverse momentum,
%if they are used for the only purpose of b-tagging then calibration is also not needed,
%however, 

Despite trackjets are more robust with respect to pileup, which makes them appealing,
they can only reconstruct the charged part of the jet, the neutral part is lost.
According to isospin invariance the expected charged fraction in a jet is roughly $2/3$ of the total,
the trackjet momentum will be then shifted and its direction will 
have a larger uncertainty. Figure~\ref{fig:residuals} shows a comparison of trackjet and calojet transverse momentum
residuals with respect to \emph{truthjet} $\pt$ (reconstructed jets from truth particle), here truthjet
are matched with jets within a $\Delta R$ cone of 0.4 (jet splitting effect are resolved by
matching with the nearest jet). 
The trackjets energy shift may be critical for b-tagging algorithm since some of them
strongly rely on the measurement of jet axis and jet $\pt$.

\begin{figure}[tp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figure/trackjet/residuals.pdf}
\caption{Residuals comparison of trackjet and calojet $\pt$ with respect simulated jet $\pt$.}
\label{fig:residuals}
\end{figure}    

To compare performance of trackjet and calojet an anti-kt cone size of $\Delta R = 0.4$ is chosen,
if a reconstructed jets lies within $\Delta R  < 0.3$ from a simulated b-hadron
in the event, this jet is said to \emph{match} with a b-hadron. 
\emph{Reconstruction efficiency} is then defined as the ratio between the number of matched b-hadron
and the total number of b-hadron within inner detector acceptance. Figure~\ref{fig:recoEff} compare b-hadron reconstruction efficiency
between calojet and trackjets, the latter shows a higher reconstruction efficiency for low 
transverse momentum due to their robustness to pileup.
\begin{figure}[tp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{figure/trackjet/recoEfficiency.pdf}
\caption{Comparison of b-hadron reconstruction efficiency for trackjet and calojet as a 
function of the simulated b-hadron $\pt$. Note that calojet and trackjet have a requirement 
at reconstruction level to be respectively with $\pt > 7$ and 2 GeV, a fair comparison in this plot is only possible
above 10 GeV in $\pt$.}
\label{fig:recoEff}
\end{figure}    

\subsection{B-tagging on Trackjets}
Performance of b-tagging algorithms are usually described by means of tagging
efficiency and rejection power. The \emph{tagging efficiency} is the fraction of matched jets 
which passes a determined selection on a tagging algorithm, i.e. which are \emph{tagged}.
The \emph{rejection} is the inverse of the misidentifying rate, i.e. the inverse of the fraction 
of the jets which are not matched with a b-hadron or c-hadron, but are tagged. Fixing the selection
value for a given tagging algorithm will fix a point in the efficiency-rejection plane, this
is a convenient way to compare performance of b-tagging algorithms and is shown in figure~\ref{fig:eff_rej}
for trackjets.
Figure~\ref{fig:rej_pt} instead shows the rejection as a function of trackjets $\pt$ for the
tagging point which gives 50\% tagging efficiency. Mistagging rate is rapidly increasing
for low transverse momentum trackjets, revealing the necessity of a dedicated tagging algorithm for 
low $\pt$ jets.

\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figure/trackjet/std_eff_rej.pdf}
\caption{Rejection as a function of the tagging efficiency for different ATLAS tagging algorithm tested on trackjets.}
\label{fig:eff_rej}
\end{figure}    

\begin{figure}[tp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figure/trackjet/std_rej_pt.pdf}
\caption{Rejection as a function of the transverse momentum of the trackjet for the

	are reported.}

\end{figure}    

\begin{figure}[tp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figure/trackjet/eff_real_rej_mod.pdf}
\caption{Effective rejection as a function of b-hadron reconstruction efficiency, trackjet and calo jets are
	compared for two different ATLAS tagging algorithms. Trackjets are selected in the transverse momentum range 
	between 4 and 33 GeV, while calojets between 8 and 50 GeV.}
\label{fig:cj_tj}
\end{figure}    

The previously introduced rejection and tagging efficiency do not allow a fair comparison between trackjets 
and calojets, the latter, in fact,  can be reconstructed also in case
no tracks are associated with them, in this case any tagging algorithm would likely fail
altering the rejection distribution. It is convenient to use instead the following quantities:
\emph{effective rejection}, which is the inverse of the number of mistagged jets per event, and the
b-hadron reconstruction efficiency, which is defined above. Figure~\ref{fig:cj_tj} shows 
a comparison between calojets and trackjets for the two variables just defined, for a given 
b-hadron reconstruction efficiency  trackjets can achieve higher rejection, which is quite promising.
For a fair comparison with calojets, trackjets in figure~\ref{fig:cj_tj} are selected in the transverse 
momentum range between 4 and 33 GeV, while
calojets between 8 and 50 GeV, this corresponds to the same range: figure~\ref{fig:residuals} in fact, is 
only valid for low $\pt$ jets  and the fraction of momentum lost  1/3 for high $\pt$ trackjets.
In conclusion, thanks to the higher b-hadron reconstruction efficiency, 
trackjets are more suitable than calojets for low transverse momentum b-tagging.

\subsection{Impact of Trackjet on the Analysis} % A new Hope
The impact of trackjets on the neutral MSSM Higgs search 
is tested in a preliminary study and reported in what follows. 
Preselections\footnote{This study has not been updated with the newest version of the object reconstruction 
		selections and corrections, a difference of the order of 10\% is expected with respect the 
	    	numbers in table~\ref{tab:eventsel:btag}.},
as defined in in section~\ref{sec:topology}, are applied to MC samples of signal and backgrounds with the following exceptions
on the definition of taggable jets:
\begin{itemize}
\item Calorimeter taggable jets should have $|\eta| < 2.5$ and $20 < \pt < 50$ GeV.
\item Track taggable jets should have $|\eta| < 2.5$ and $5 < \pt < 33$ GeV.
\item The tagging algorithm used is "IP3D+SV1" at its 70\% tagging efficiency point.
%this correspond to the same
%  	range as for calojets above, figure~\ref{fig:residuals} in fact is only valid for low $\pt$ jets
%	and the fraction of momentum lost  1/3 for high $\pt$ trackjets. 
\end{itemize} 
the event yields for $bbA/h/H$ production, $\Ztautau$  and $\ttbar$ (the two most important backgrounds of the b-tag category) 
are reported in table~\ref{tab:tj_cj} normalized to an integrated luminosity of $1 ~ fb^{-1}$.
Along with the preselection yields other interesting selections are reported, those are X
for the caracterization of jet and b-tagging impact on the analysis, calojets and trackjets yields 
are compared for each of them.
As expected, after requiring exactly one b-tagged jet, trackjets presents higher efficiency on signal
and higher rejection of top background, which is the most important background for the b-tag category.
However, lower transverse momentum requirements on trackjets implies higer tagging fake rates, which is seen as an 
increase of $\Ztautau$ background, this may be also a serious issue for QCD multi-jet background, 
even tough this is a minor background in b-tag category.

Concluding, the use of trackjets in the b-tag category is very promising
and can bring up to twice better sensitivity\footnote{Note that this estimate is done according to $s/\sqrt{b}$ ratio,
considering a counting experiment without systematic uncertainties and only two backgrounds, it represent then the upper limit 
to the gain in sensitivity with the current b-tagging performance.}, 
however, to exploit the full power of this technique a dedicated b-tagging calibration on
trackjets is needed, study on algorithm improvements for low $\pt$ b-tagging are also auspicable, furthermore, 
systematics uncertainty on trackjets need to be evaluated. A preliminary study, addressing one of the most important 
systematics uncertainty for trackjets, is reported in section~\ref{sec:trackjetsys}.

\section{Systematic Uncertainties on Trackjets}\label{sec:trackjetsys}
\subsection{Introduction to Trackjet Systematics}
%why Energy scale...
%Uncertainty on physics observable related to trackjets due to MC mismodeling needs to be evaluated,
%uncertainty arises from non perfect modeling of trackjets direction, energy scale and reconstruction efficiency,
%
%There are several sources that may give contribution to systematic uncertainties on the energy scale of trackjet, those
%effects  are briefly summarized in what follows. 
%
There are several sources of systematic uncertainties on trackjets that may contribute to
physics observables mismodeling,  those effects  are briefly summarized in what follows, the focus is on 
energy scale and reconstruction efficiency systematic uncertainties. %since they will have the biggest
%impact on any physics observable that may be interesting for us.

Uncertainty can arise from MC generator details, like the particular 
choice of PDF and fragmentation fuctions, or details of the parton shower and underlying event, 
challenging to simulate for low transverse momentum object. Those uncertainty can be evaluated by means of
a dedicated MC Rivet \cite{RIVET} analysis, they will be dependent on the specific use of trackjets and 
need to be evaluated case by case.

Energy scale and resolution for single tracks is found to be very well modeled by simulation for tracks above
500 MeV \cite{IDperformance}, thus, uncertainty on the energy scale and resolution that arise form mismodeling of
the pattern recognition algorithm are considered to be negligible. 

In dense track environment  different tracks may share 
same hits and this can genarate degradation of resolution, fake tracks, loss of track efficiency.
Mismodeling of tracks shared hits may affect in general trackjet energy scale, resolution and reconstruction efficiency. 
This kind of effects has been checked in~\cite{JEStrack}, where calojet energy scale 
uncertainty are measured using tracks, it has been shown that effects due to tracks hit merging are negligible 
for jets with $\pt < 300$~GeV.

Mismodeling of the inner detector material budged leads
to track reconstruction efficiency mismodeling, which strongly affects trackjets.
A methododology to estimate energy scale and recostruction efficiency uncertainty on trackjets, due to material
budget mismodeling, is presented for the first time in section~\ref{sec:trackExMat}.


\subsection{Trackjets Uncertainty from Material Budget } \label{sec:trackExMat} %general description of the method
An obvious, but rather uncovinient way, to estimate uncertainty due to inner detector (ID) material budget mismodeling,
is to produce the relevant MC samples of a given analysis modifying the ID material budget in them.
It can be shown that the primary effect of material budget mismodeling influences mainly
track reconstruction efficiency (see section~\ref{sec:valid}), an alternative approach would be then to
modify the track efficiency in a given sample according to its uncertainty~\cite{IDMaterial,trackEff} and build 
trackjets out of the new collection of tracks.
A tool has been made which randomly removes tracks according to reconstruction efficiency uncertainty, 
trackjets which are build out of this subset of tracks are called in the
following \emph{INEF-trackjets}. 

A minimum bias MC simulation sample is reproduced containing standard 
trackjets and INEF-trackjets. A set of "isolated" trackjet with cone size $\Delta R = 0.4$ are selected, isolated 
means that no other trackjet should be reconstructed within a distance of $\Delta R = 1$. 
INEF-trackjets are then matched with the original trackjet
via cone matching in an event by event basis, the matching fails if no INEF-trackjet is found within $\Delta R = 0.8$ from
the original one. Result on the deterioration of the trackjets efficiency and of the energy scale are presented respectively in 
figure~\ref{fig:inef_tj_std_eff} and~\ref{fig:inef_tj_std_scale}, these results are based on the current knowledge of inner detector 
material budged~\cite{IDMaterial}. For low transverse momentum trackjets, uncertainty on the material budget 
translates into an energy scale shift of 2-4\% and in a reduction of the mean number of tracks.
This method can only simulate excess of material (reduced track efficiency) but not a lack of material
(increased track efficiency), however, for the latter case a symmetric effect is expected.

\end{figure}    


\subsection{Track Subtraction Method Validation} %confermo che l'effetto di Ex material e' solo efficiency
\label{sec:valid}
%effect on tracks of a 10% EX sample
The method described in section~\ref{sec:trackExMat} depends strongly on the assumption that 
%the main effect of 
% material budget mismodeling is a loss or gain in track recontruction efficiency, meaning that 
hadronic secondary interaction, whithin the inner detector, leads manly to lost of tracks 
and only in a marginal way to a decrease of tracks quality, a consequence is that
material budget mismodeling influences mainly track reconstruction efficiency.
%this is equivalent to say that the quality selection on tracks are robust enought.
In this section, effect of  material budget uncertainty on tracks resolution and fake rate are eveluated,
this is achieved by means of a simulated sample of minimum bias events, where  extra material 
is added to the ID increasing uniformly of 10\% the interaction lenght.  

The requirement on tracks are the ones defined 
in section~\ref{sec:tj_intro}, furthermore a track should be matched within $\Delta R <0.1$ with a 
stable\footnote{Here is intended a Generator stable and interacting particle,
 which means a charged particle with decay lenght greather than 1m,
also stable particle from secondary interactions are considered.} 
simulated particle which should be responsable (alone) of at least 80\% of the track hits, tracks that do not fullfil
these requirements are called fakes. 
Fake tracks are tracks that come from a random combination of hits generated from different particles.
% from simulation
%is easy to identify this kind of "fake" by means of a truth particle-to-track matching, for each track
%in fact, is stored its matching probability with the particle who share the most hits of it.
The track fake rate, shown in figure~\ref{fig:trk_fakereate}, is about 1-3\%, the extra material sample has 
a total increase of the track fake rate of permille.
Resolution as shown in figure~\ref{fig:trk_reso} is about 1\% for large range of tracks $\pt$, the total increase
of resolution in the extra material sample is also of the order of permille. 
The deterioration of the tracks resolution and fake rate due to extra material  is then negligible compared to 
the one of track reconstruction efficiency, which undergo to a total decrease in the extra material sample of 1-2\%,
decrease in efficiency has serious impact on trackjet energy scale.
Figure~\ref{fig:trk_eff} shows the ratio of the track reconstruction
efficiency of primary particle between the standard and extra material sample.

Results from INEF-trackjets (builded in a standard sample) are also directly compared with trackjets from 
extra material sample, the comparison is done by means of trackjet-to-truthjet matching (see section~\ref{sec:tj_perf}
for truthjets matching) and is reported in figure~\ref{fig:tj10tjex_eff} and~\ref{fig:tj10tjex_pt}
for reconstruction efficiency and energy scale respectively. INEF-trackjets shows to reproduce correclty 
the effect of extra material either on  reconstruction efficiency and energy scale, giving, in most of the cases,
a conservative estimate.
