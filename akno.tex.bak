First of all I would like to thank Prof. Hubert Kroha and Dr. Sandra Kortner for the precious comment and help 
during editing this document and to gave me the extraordinary opportunity of being here. 
I would like to thank the Max Planck Institute and the organizers of IMPRS, 
with a special thank to Frank Steffen.

I would like to thank the members of the neutral MSSM Higgs boson search analysis team, in particular 
M. Backingham and N. Romptis, for being of such a great support during the last year.

I recived an incredible amount of support from many persons.
They made my stay in Munich, a jurney, an adventure and have created 
an atmosphere that smells of home. It is to this big family that 
I want to address my most deep thanks. In order of appearance in this  fairy tail that has been
my life here. To my almost russian roommate for being german enough for both of us and for his hard time with me.
 To Mr. bamboo Toyama with the  wish he wont be too ``heabi'' with the little Ko. To Shangy for being... himself, hoping one day he will find
his soul. To the Ogre for teaching me the difference between pig and pork and to Fiona for being a good spezi.
To la Bruja Piruja, well, actually I don't know why she is in the list. To Sear-gay for the puzzling and oniric discussions.
But, most of all, I would like to thank the love of my life, the blond A.
I hope any of you will manage one day to catch the duck is chaising.


Finally I would like to thank you, the reader, for being brave enough to arrive till this point of this document.
