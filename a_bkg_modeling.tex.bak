\section{Background Modeling and Validation}
\label{sec:BackgroundEstimation}

This section describes the strategies for background modeling and validation.
Monte Carlo  simulation is extesively used for model either background and signal, 
the  simulations of any process are usually prone to systematics
uncertainties due to non-perfect descriptions of pileup effects,
underlying event and detector performance, therefore,
data-driven background esimation method are employed for the estimate of $\Ztautau$ and QCD multi-jet backgrounds,
described respectively in section~\ref{sec:ztau} and~\ref{sec:qcd}.
%stimate backgrounds from data. In particular for the following cases:
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item[$\bullet$] The $Z \rightarrow \tau\tau \rightarrow ll ~ + ~  4\nu$ is estimated from data using the embedding technique described in Section~\ref{sec:data_mc}.
%  \item[$\bullet$] The multi-jet background is estimated completely from data using the so-called ABCD method.   
%\end{itemize}
Other background processes, such as \ttbar, single top, dibosons, $Z
\rightarrow ll$ + jets (where $l = e,\mu$) and W + jets, are estimated
using MC predictions. Given the particular importance of \ttbar a dedicated study to validate
this background has been made and described in section~\ref{sec:top_est}.

A good agreement between data and background model is found after the common selections, 
this is supported by figure~\ref{fig:validation} which shows few kinematic variables and
figure~\ref{fig:selections} which shows analysis selection variables after common selections.

\subsection{Top Quark Pair Production Validation}
\label{sec:top_est}

The background from top quark pair production is estimated using a sample of simulated events with POWHEG-PYTHIA MC
generator. Since this is one of the major backgrounds for this analysis a careful validation is needed, for this purpose
 a \ttbar rich and signal-depleted data control sample is defined using events passing 
the common selections  with the additional requirement of two b-tagged jets.
%Since this is one of the major backgrounds for this analysis (especially in b-tag category)
%a careful validation of this background model is need, for this purpose a  top quark enriched control region (CR)  
%is defined by adding to the preselection the further requirement of exactly two b-tagged jets in the event. 
Figures~\ref{fig:kinematicsttbar} and~\ref{fig:cutsttbar} show a set of kinematic and analysis selection
variables in this data sample, good agreement between data and MC prediction is found:
%and shows that our top-quark background model describes well the data
%Also the prediction of the event yield in this CR is in good agreement with data: 
an overall data to background ratio of $0.998 \pm 0.011\mathrm{(stat.)} \pm 0.110 \mathrm{(sys.)}$ is observed. 
The total systematic uncertainty on the ratio is dominated by the uncertainty on the b-tagging efficiency. 
%In addition, this result could be used
%as a measure of $t\bar{t}$ normalisation avoiding systematic uncertainty on the theoretical cross section of
%this process. In this case, however, additional acceptance systematics would need to be evaluated in a dedicated study.
%
%with a dedicated RIVET analysis and uncertainties of the order of the cross section 
%uncertainty are expected, we then drop this possibility considering that wont bring  
%significant improvements.

\subsection{Multi-jet Background}
\label{sec:qcd}

The QCD multi-jet background represents an important background, 
especially in the b-veto category, due to its high cross-section and the 
relatively low cut on lepton \pt used in this analysis. This
background is evaluated by a data-driven technique, the so-called ABCD method.
The ABCD method consists of splitting the set of data events after the common selections in four samples: the
signal sample, defined by the event selections described in Section~\ref{sec:selection}
and three signal-depleted control data sample, which do not share events and are
designed to be enriched in multi-jets events. The four samples are defined by using the relative 
sign of the charge of  the leptons and  isolation selections. 
To obtain data samples rich in multi-jet background, the selections on both
the calorimetric and tracking isolation, described in Section~\ref{sec:presel},  are inverted with respect to the
nominal ones defining anti-isolated leptons. Is then
possible to define four data samples: opposite sign (OS) or same sign
(SS) with respectively isolated or anti-isolated leptons. Historically
the letters A-D are assigned to this data samples for a quicker reference as
defined in Table~\ref{table:qcd}.

\begin{table} [tp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c c c }
\hline
sample & Lepton Charge & Lepton Isolation \\ [0.5ex]
\hline
A (signal sample) & OS & isolated \\
B & SS & isolated \\
C & OS & anti-isolated \\
D & SS & anti-isolated \\ [1ex]
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{QCD background estimation control samples, defined by having leptons with opposite signs (OS) or same signs (SS) and by having the leptons either isolated or anti-isolated.}
\label{table:qcd}
\end{table}

An assumption of the ABCD method is that multi-jet backgrounds
populate the OS and SS events independently of lepton isolation
criteria, or in other words that the ratio of OS/SS events is uncorrelated 
with the lepton isolation selections. In this case, the number of QCD events in the signal sample $A$ 
can be estimated from the yield of multi-jet events in the control samples $B$, $C$ and $D$, using the equation
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:qcdest}
N_{A}  = N_{B} \times \frac{N_{C}}{N_{D}} =  N_{B} \times \rqcd
\end{equation}
%Here is  assumed that the events in the control samples come solely from QCD multi-jet processes, contamination
%from electroweak (W and Z + jets, dibosons) and top processes
%($t\bar{t}$ and single top production) are  subtracted in each control sample 
%using the MC prediction for their event yield.  
To obtain the multi-jet yields in the data control samples, the contamination
from electroweak (W+jets, Z+jets and dibosons) and top processes
($t\bar{t}$ and single top production) are  subtracted in each control sample 
using the MC prediction for their event yield.  Tables~\ref{table:qcd_yield_btag}~and~\ref{table:qcd_yield_bveto}
show the event yield
% in the b-tagged and b-veto categories, respectively,
for each control sample throughout the full cut-flows along with the
predictions of non-QCD multi-jets events which are subtracted.
Signal contamination has been checked in all the three control samples for different 
mass points. For the range of $m_{A}$ and $\mathrm{tan}\beta$ considered in this analysis, the highest signal contamination 
is seen in sample B for the mass point $m_{A} = 300$ GeV and $\mathrm{tan}\beta = 50$, where  a contamination 
of 0.2\% is observed\footnote
{
This value is mainly due to b-associated production and,
as it scales with the cross section, for $\mathrm{tan}\beta = 20$ would be an order of magnitude smaller.
}.

Shapes of kinematic distributions for QCD events are taken from 
sample B, this sample is expected to have similar kinematic property to the signal sample, however, suffers of either lower statistics 
and higher contamination with respect to sample C or D.
This choice is made to avoid a shape bias due to isolation requirements at trigger level (only the single-electron trigger ask for isolation),
%the trigger:  an isolated trigger is used 
%for electrons (as described in Section~\ref{sec:eventsel}), where the offline requirement equivalent to this trigger choice is $\ptcone20/\pt <0.1$.
figure~\ref{fig:BvsD} shows the comparison between the electron $\pt$ distributions in sample B and D, 
in the latter high $\pt$ electrons are suppressed, they do not pass trigger selections. 
Eventually the trigger isolation requirement could
bias also the ratio OS/SS, this possibility has been checked carefully
in a dedicated study and reported in Appendix \ref{appendix:qcd}:
to a good approximation, such trigger effects cancel out in the ratio
OS/SS and no additional systematic is needed.

To test the ABCD method predictions an additional control sample has been defined with the following selections:
\begin{itemize}
\item \MET $< 20$ GeV
\item \Ht $< 70$ GeV and \SumLtMET$ < 50$ GeV
\item $0 < \mmc < 80$ GeV  	 
\end{itemize}
This control sample is designed to enhance multi-jet background with respect to \Ztautau keeping the final 
state kinematics as similar as possible to the signal sample.
Figure~\ref{fig:ABCD_cr} shows the \mmc distribution for this control sample with and without b-tagging requirements, 
agreement between data and the background model is found within statistical and detector related systematics uncertainty.

Systematic uncertainties are assigned on the scaling factor \rqcd and on the shape of
the discriminating variable \mmc to take into account any correlation between isolation and charge 
of the leptons, details on the systematic uncertainty evaluation are addressed in Section~\ref{sec:Systematics}.





\subsection{$Z \rightarrow \tau\tau$ + Jets Background: Embedding Technique}\label{sec:ztau}
The background from \Ztautau decays is the major background to this analysis, a good uderstanding 
of it is then crucial.
 Unfortunately, for a light Higgs boson, it is impossible to completely separate \Ztautau decays 
from the signal and a signal free data control sample cannot be defined.
However, thanks to the small Higgs coupling to muons, \Zmumu decays provide a good starting point to 
model \Ztautau events in a data-driven way. An hybrid Data-MC sample, known as "Embedding" is used to model the \Ztautau background: 
$\Zmumu$ candidates are selected in data, then, the two muons from the $Z$ decay are substituted with the decay 
products from simulated taus, this means that the energy deposit and tracks in a cone around the muon are subtracted
and substituted with the one from $\tau$ decay, those taus have the same kinematics as the original muons. 
Further details on this technique may be found in \cite{Embedding, SMold}.

%The selection of the \Zmumu input data requires exactly two combined, opposite charged
%muons, where the leading muon has a transverse momentum $\pt > 20 \GeV$ and 
%the subleading muon $\pt > 15\GeV$. Both muons are requited to lie within $|\eta|<2.5$ and to be isolated with 
%$\ptcone 20/\pt<0.2$ (see Section~\ref{sec:presel}). Additionally 
%the invariant mass of the two muons is required to be in the range $M_{\mu\mu} > 40$ GeV.
%Once the muon pair events are selected, all tracks and calorimeter cells associated to the muons are 
%removed from the \Zmumu data event. Finally, the calorimeter cell energy and tracks from the simulated tau decays
%are added to the data event and the event is re-reconstructed.

%A set of corrections are applied to correct for the muon trigger efficiency, the muon reconstruction efficiency and other additional effects
%related to the original \Zmumu events. Finally, as the trigger is not emulated in the embedding sample, 
%an additional correction is applied to emulate the electron and muon trigger efficiencies in the final \Ztautau embedded events. 
%For a full description of the corrections and validation see \cite{SMnew}.

%The Embedding technique, which uses \Zmumu decays to 
%model \Ztautau events in a data-driven way, is described in Section~\ref{sec:data_mc}. 
Trigger is not simulated in the Embedding samples, the event yield
is normalised to ALPGEN \Ztautau at common selection stage. Furthermore a set of corrections, as described in \cite{SMnew}, are
applied to unfold from the original \Zmumu trigger and reconstruction efficiency, then trigger and reconstruction efficiency 
for a $e-\mu$ final state are emulated by means of event weight.

The Embedding technique has been validated in several studies, detailed in~\cite{Embedding, SMnew}, which show a good description of 
data and \Ztautau MC by Embedding. In the context of this analysis, 
figures~\ref{fig:emb_vs_alp1} and \ref{fig:emb_vs_alp} show comparisons of various kinematic variables between
data, Embedding and ALPGEN \Ztautau simulated events at common selection. No significant deviation is seen 
between the \mmc distribution of the Embedding and ALPGEN samples, 
however other relevant variables for this analysis, such as the \MET 
and the number of b-jets, are slightly better described by Embedding.

The Embedding sample is based on selecting \Zmumu candidates in data, the selections assure a rather 
pure \Zmumu sample, however further selections used in this analysis, for example the b-tagging requirements, 
could enhance the contamination fraction from other processes. Dedicated studies have been
made to estimate the $t\bar{t}$ and QCD multi-jet contamination in the Embedding sample.
The \ttbar~ contamination is estimated by evaluating the Embedding yield in a two b-tag control sample
(as described in Section~\ref{sec:top_est}), these events are assumed to be solely from $t\bar{t}$
and their yield in the signal sample is extrapolated using MC simulation.
Table~\ref{table:emb_cont_tt} shows a summary for the top contamination in Embedding. 
The multi-jet contamination can be estimated starting 
from the Embedding yield in (ABCD) sample C,
%one should not use SS samples because embedding already requires leptons to be OS, then would be biased
assuming all events in this control sample as QCD multi-jet events, the contamination in the signal sample 
can be estimated by means of the ABCD method (see Section~\ref{sec:qcd}). The \rqcd factor, in this case, 
is evaluated using a $\mu-\mu$ final state with same kinematic selections as for Embedding \Zmumu candidate.
Table~\ref{table:emb_cont_qcd}
shows the estimated contamination of QCD multi-jet in Embedding. 
Contamination effects are considered negligible.
