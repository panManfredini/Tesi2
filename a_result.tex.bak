\subsection{Statistical Interpretation of the Data}
\label{sec:limits}
The statistical interpretation of data is based on the profiled likelihood ratio test statistic as 
for the SM Higgs boson searches~\cite{lhclimits}. The statistical procedures described in the 
following are implemented in the software packages described in~\cite{roofit,roostat,histfactory} used for this analysis.

\subsubsection{The Likelihood Function}
The compatibility of \textit{background only}  and \textit{signal-plus-background}  hypotheses with the observed data is evaluated.  
%Statistical tests are used to quantify the significance of an observation or to set an exclusion limits, 
%in a search for new phenomena, hypothesis testing is performed by means of two hypothesis: 
%the \textit{background only} $H_0$ and and the \textit{signal-plus-background} $H_1$ hypothesis.  
The \emph{test statistic} defined below is based on a binned likelihood function for the data set $\mathcal{D}$:
\begin{multline}\label{likelihood}
\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D}\,|\,\mu, \boldsymbol{\theta}) =  \prod_{i} \text{Pois(} n_i\, |\, \mu \cdot s_i(\boldsymbol{\theta}) 
	+ b_i(\boldsymbol{\theta})) \cdot \Gamma(\theta^{stat}_i \,| \,\beta_i) 
	 \cdot \prod_{j}\mathcal{G}(\theta_j^{sys} \, |\, 0, 1) ~ 
\end{multline}
describing how likely is a certain hypothesis given the observation of the data set $\mathcal{D}$.
The signal strength parameter $\mu$ allows for reproducing a continuous set of signal hypotheses with 
different cross-section. The value  $\mu= 0$ corresponds to the background-only hypothesis. 
The vector $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ represents the set of \emph{nuisance} parameters  corresponding to
the statistical ($\theta^{stat}_i$) and systematic ($\theta_j^{sys}$) uncertainties in  the signal and background. 
The functions $s_i(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ and  $b_i(\boldsymbol{\theta})$
represent the expected yield of signal and background  for the bin $i$ of the \mmc distribution histograms.
The function $\mathcal{G}(\theta_j^{sys} ~ | ~ 0, 1)$
is the  Gaussian\footnote{Evaluation of systematic uncertainties is obtained from auxiliary measurements. From Bayes theorem,
	assuming a flat prior and a Gaussian distribution for the measured parameter a Gaussian posterior is obtained.	
}
probability density function (p.d.f.) for the nuisance parameter $\theta_j^{sys}$ with mean~=~0 and $\sigma = 1$.  
The impact of the corresponding systematic uncertainty
on the  signal and backgrounds yields and on the shape of the \mmc invariant mass distributions
 is evaluated separately as described in Section~\ref{sec:Systematics}.
The function  $\Gamma(\theta^{stat}_i | \beta_i)$ is an extended gamma function\footnote{The posterior of a
	Poisson distribution assuming a flat prior is a gamma function}
providing the p.d.f. for the nuisance parameter $\theta^{stat}_i$ associated
to the statistical uncertainty $ \beta_i$ in  bin $i$ of the \mmc distribution.
The values of the nuisance parameter set $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ are associated with  variations of the predicted
signal and background event yields with respect to the nominal prediction.
%are evaluated represent
%the uncertainties on the signal and background yields,  or mass shape of the analysis, those uncertainties 
%are usually measured by auxiliary measure to the analysis, like JES for example, or come from theory uncertainty,
%the single p.d.f. of the parameter $\theta_i$ is assumed Gaussian distributed 
%where and it is only function of the parameter $\mu$ and of the
%nuisance parameter $\boldsymbol{\theta}$. If the hypothesis under test is unlikely to happen with the given dataset the value of 
%$\mathcal{L}$ is decreasing,
%one can define which is the best value of a parameter that describes the data via maximising the likelihood,
%obtaining a so called maximum likelihood estimator. 
The Poisson distributions in equation~\eqref{likelihood} give the probability to observe $n_i$ events in the bin \textit{i} of the \mmc 
distribution histogram:
$$
 \text{Pois(}n_i ~ | ~ \mu \cdot s_i(\boldsymbol{\theta}) + b_i(\boldsymbol{\theta})) =  \frac{(\mu s_i(\boldsymbol{\theta}) 
	+b_i(\boldsymbol{\theta}))^{n_i}}{n_i!} ~ e^{-\mu s_i(\boldsymbol{\theta})  -b_i(\boldsymbol{\theta})} \,.
$$
The \mmc distributions in the b-tagged and b-vetoed categories are analysed separately.
The  implementation of the ABCD method in the likelihood function is based on~\cite{ABCD}
and is described in more detail in Appendix~\ref{appendix:limit}.

\subsubsection{Statistical Combination of Results}
Complementary event categories of a search channel (like the b-tagged and b-vetoed categories) 
can be combined in order to increase the signal sensitivity.
If there are no shared events between the categories the combined likelihood function is simply the product
of the likelihoods of the individual categories. The  convention described in~\cite{lhclimits} is used
to take into account correlations of uncertainties in the two combined categories.
The systematic uncertainties are considered either as fully correlated, which means that the same nuisance parameter
describes the corresponding  systematic effect in both categories,  or as fully uncorrelated, in which case different nuisance parameters are
employed for the two categories. Partially correlated uncertainties are either split into components which are 
(un)correlated or they are defined  to be either fully correlated or uncorrelated, depending on which assumption is the most conservative.



\subsubsection{Exclusion Limit Computation}
To compute the compatibility of the data with a given hypothesis, the \emph{profiled likelihood ratio}~\cite{Asympt} 
\begin{equation}
\tilde{q_{\mu}} ~ = ~ -2 \text{ln} ~ \frac{\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D}~|~\mu, \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_{\mu})}{\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D} ~| ~ 
\hat{\mu}, \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}})}
\quad \text{with the constraint} \quad 0 \leq \hat{\mu} \leq \mu
\end{equation}
is used as test statistic with the likelihood function $\mathcal{L}$ defined in equation~\eqref{likelihood}. $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}$ 
are the global maximum likelihood estimators for $\mu$ and $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ from fit to the dataset $\mathcal{D}$, 
whereas $\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_{\mu}$ is the maximum likelihood estimator of $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ from the fit  with
a fixed signal strength $\mu$. $\tilde{q_{\mu}}$ is increasing with 
increasing disagreement between data and the given $\mu$ hypothesis.
Upper limits on the signal cross-section are then defined as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
%	\item The signal hypothesis with signal strength $\mu$ is assumed, under this assumption a set of MC 
%	\textit{pseudo-data} is generated for different values of $\mu$.
%
%	\item  $\tilde{q_{\mu}}$ is calculated for each of the \textit{pseudo-dataset} and each signal hypothesis generating
%	the expected probability density function for $\tilde{q_{\mu}}$ given $\mu$, 
%	$\text{f}(\tilde{q_{\mu}} ~| ~ \mu, \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_{\mu},H_1)$.
%
%	\item The same procedure is repeated for the null hypothesis: pseudo-data are generated with the distribution 
%	of background only and 	obtain  the $\text{f}(\tilde{q_{\mu}} ~ | ~ \mu = 0, \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_{0}, H_0)$.
%
	\item The probability density functions $P(\tilde{q_{\mu}} \,| \, \text{H}_i)$ of $\tilde{q_{\mu}}$ are determined  under the background-only ($H_0$) and 
	the  signal-plus-background ($H_{\mu}$) hypotheses for a  given values of $\mu$.
	Since the determination of these functions by means of Monte Carlo simulation of pseudo-dataset ($\mathcal{D}$)	demands large computing resources,
	the asymptotic approximation formulae described in~\cite{Asympt} are employed.
	

	\item Once the p.d.f. for the background-only and signal-plus-background hypothesis are obtained, 
	it is possible to define for a given dataset $\mathcal{D}$ two probability values (p-values) for  given value of $\mu$.
	These are the probabilities to obtain data less compatible with the considered hypothesis than the 
	actual observation:
	$$
	p_{s+b} = P(\tilde{q_{\mu}} > \tilde{q_{\mu}}^{observed} ~ | ~ H_{\mu})  
	$$
	$$ 
	p_{b} = P(\tilde{q_{\mu}} > \tilde{q_{\mu}}^{observed} ~ | ~ H_0)
	$$
%	The ratio of this two probabilities defines the quantity $CL_{s} = p_{s+b} / p_{b}$ \cite{cls1,cls2}.

	\item If the ratio $CL_{s} = p_{s+b} / p_{b}$~\cite{cls1,cls2} of the two p-values is less than a given value $\alpha$,
	the signal-plus-background hypothesis with the corresponding $\mu$ is said to be excluded at  (1 - $\alpha$) $CL_{s}$ confidence level. 
	The 95\% confidence level upper limit on $\mu$,
	denoted as $\mu^{95}$, is  the smallest value of $\mu$ for which the  $CL_{s} \le 0.05$\,.

\end{enumerate}
%This is a quite complicated prescription, however 
%its interpretation is not so different from the usual Neyman Construction~\cite{} of confidence intervals:
%for each $\mu$ is possible to define $\tilde{q_{\mu}}^{95}$ for which the probability 
%P$(\tilde{q_{\mu}} \geq \tilde{q_{\mu}}^{95} ~ |~ \mu, ~ H_1$) = 5\%, this means that if $H_1$ is true one expects 
%$\tilde{q_{\mu}} \geq \tilde{q_{\mu}}^{95}$ in 5\% of the cases. With this definition $\mu^{95}$ would be the value of $\mu$
%that for the observed data gives $\tilde{q_{\mu}} = \tilde{q_{\mu}}^{95}$, or in other words a p-value of 5\%.
By construction, rejecting all values of $\mu > \mu^{95}$, the signal-plus-background hypothesis will be 
rejected when it is true at most 5\% of the time.
%given the fact that $\tilde{q_{\mu}}$ is increasing with increasing discrepancy of the hypothesis with data.
The $CL_{s}$ limits are considered conservative and  protected against downward  fluctuations of the data.
% For each pseudo-data sample one can calculate then $\mu^{95}$, which is the biggest value of $\mu$ which gives $\tilde{q_{\mu}} > \tilde{q_{\mu}}^{95}$
%
% Generate a large set of pseudo-data under the hypothesis $H_{0}$ and calculate  $\mu^{95}$ for each of them, by construction one would have
%	that if $H_1$ is true for $\mu > \mu^{95}$ one has $\tilde{q_{\mu}} > \tilde{q_{\mu}}^{95}$ only 5\% of the cases.
%	
%So one it is said that the $\mu > \mu^{95}$ are excluded by data under the hypothesis $H_1$ at 95\% of Confidence Level, meaning that 
%for value of $\mu > \mu^{95}$  one would reject the $H_1$ when is true at most 5\% of the time. 
%
The expected median upper-limit and its error are evaluated with the asymptotic approximation formulae under the background-only hypothesis.
The results have been cross-checked using generated pseudo-data instead of the asymptotic approximation formulae for the determination
of the  probability density functions of $\tilde{q_{\mu}}$. 


\subsubsection{Significance Test of the Background Only Hypothesis}
In case an excess of events is observed  in a given mass range with respect to the background model predictions,
the presence of a signal is quantified by the backgroundi-only p-value,
 i.e. the probability that the background fluctuation
and gives rise to an excess of events at least as large as the observed one.

To evaluate the significance of an excess the following  test statistic $q_0$ is chosen:
\begin{equation}
q_0 ~ = ~  -2 \text{ln} ~ \frac{\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D}~|~0, \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_{0})}{\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D} ~| ~ \hat{\mu}, \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}})}
 ~ ~ \text{with} ~  \hat{\mu} \ge 0\,.
\end{equation}
The test statistic is defined for a given set of signal hypotheses. To determine the \emph{local} p-value,
the probability density function of $q_0$ is evaluated under the background-only hypothesis for a specific signal mass.  
Since the test of the background only hypothesis is made for many different signal masses, the chance to obtain in the full
mass range a p-value smaller than a predetermined value increases. This is called \emph{look elsewhere effect}~\cite{LEE}
and has to be accounted for in local p-value computation. This is done by counting the number of p-value upper fluctuations over
a defined treshold and downgrading the maximum local p-value by this effect, for more detail see~\cite{lhclimits,LEE}.

To convert the p-value into a significance $Z$, the convention of one sided Gaussian tail is adopted:
\begin{equation}
\text{p-value} = \int_Z^\infty \, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2} \, dx \,.
\end{equation}
The 5$\sigma$ significance ($Z = 5$) value which  commonly characterizes a discovery corresponds to an 
extremely  small p-value of $2.8 \times 10^{-7}\,.$

Expected and observed event yields are compared in bins of the \mmc mass distribution. The bin sizes are
chosen such that the number of events per bin is high enough to justify the use of the 
asymptotic approximation,  Figure \ref{fig:mmc_categories} shows the \mmc  distributions and Table~\ref{table:final_numbers} compares the expected 
and the observed event yields  after the full selection in both categories.
The predictions of the  background model are evaluated as described in Section~\ref{sec:BackgroundEstimation}, the notation 
``Other'' stands for the electroweak processes $\Wlnu$, $\Zll$, diboson and single top quark production and 
the signal contribution is evaluated in the  $m_{h}^{mod}$ scenario for values of $m_A=150$ GeV and $\tan \beta =20$ considering the production 
of $A$, $h$ and $H$ via  $gg\rightarrow A/h/H$ and $pp\rightarrow b(b)A/h/H$. Figure~\ref{fig:somefinaldistro1} and~\ref{fig:somefinaldistro2} show
the distributions of different kinematical variables after the full selection in the b-tagged and b-vetoed category, respectively. 
Additional distribution can be found in Appendix~\ref{appendix:result}.

\subsection{Exclusion Limits on the Signal Production}


The statistical procedure described in section~\ref{sec:limits} is  the general one used for the SM Higgs
boson search at the LHC where only the Higgs boson mass determines the signal properties. For the MSSM a complication
arise since  there are three neutral Higgs bosons contributing to the signal yield.
In a particular scenario their masses and production cross sections are defined 
by the two parameters $\tan \beta$ and $m_A$. Thus, the  procedure described above
 has to be repeated for each point in the $\tan \beta - m_A$ plane. 
%For a given scenario, 
%a point in the  $\tan \beta - m_A$ plane is excluded with 95\% $CL_{s}$ confidence level if $\mu^{95} \leq 1$ for that point. 
%Only a limited number of $\tan \beta - m_A$ points are generated, 
%a linear interpolation is used to determine the $\tan \beta$ excluded for a given $m_A$.
Exclusion limits at $95\%$ CLs confidence level in the $m_h^{mod}$ scenario  
are derived in the $\tan \beta - m_A$ plane based on the production cross section times branching ratio for
the neutral MSSM Higgs bosons ($A/h/H$) produced via $gg\rightarrow A/h/H$ and $pp\rightarrow b(b)A/h/H$
 and in decays $A$/$H$/$h\to\tau\tau\to \mu e + 4\nu$. 
A grid has been set up in the $\tan \beta - m_A$ plane with 15 tan$\beta$ values\footnote{
			The set of  tan$\beta$ values used
			is 5, 8, 10, 13, 16, 20, 23, 26, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60}  
in the range between 5 and 60 and 12 $m_A$ values\footnote{ The set of $m_A$ values used is: 90, 100, 110, 120, 125, 130,
                        140, 150, 170, 200, 250 and 300 GeV}
in the range from 90 to 300 GeV. A point in the  $\tan \beta - m_A$ plane is excluded if $\mu^{95} \leq 1$,
a linear interpolation is used to determine the excluded $\tan \beta$ value for a given $m_A$.

The exclusion limits in the $m_A - \tan\beta$ parameter space  of the MSSM  $m_{h}^{mod}$ benchmark scenario
are  shown in Figure~\ref{fig:limit_extract_combined} for the combination of b-tagged and b-vetoed category, while Figure~\ref{fig:limit_extract_combined2}
shows the limits for the  b-tagged and b-vetoed category separately. 
The expected and observed exclusion limits at $95\%$ $CL_s$  confidence level 
are shown as dashed and solid black lines, respectively. The green 
and yellow bands correspond to the $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ error bands on the expected exclusion limit. 
No significant excess over the expected SM background prediction is observed, $\tan\beta \geq 10$ in 
the mass range $90<m_A<200$~GeV is excluded with 95\%  $CL_s$ confidence level.  
The highest local p-value of 2.9\%  is observed in the mass rage $250< m_A <300$~GeV 
which  corresponds to a $1.9\,\sigma$ excess of events above the expected background  after the look elsewere effect is considered. 
This small excess is driven by a fluctuation of the data in the b-vetoed category as can be seen from Figure~\ref{fig:mmc_categories}.
The excess is not confirmed by the other search channels.
An attempt to interpret the excess as a scalar boson with a mass of 250~GeV is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:excess}. 
The signal is assumed to be produced via gluon fusion and its cross section is scaled to the observed upper limit for this mass.
Further cross checks on this excess of events can be found in Appendix~\ref{appendix:limit}.

The outcome of the search is also interpreted in a model-independent way, by setting  limits
on the cross-section times branching ration into $\tau$ pairs of a scalar boson produced via
gluon fusion, $pp \rightarrow gg \rightarrow \phi$,  or in association with b-quarks  $pp \rightarrow b\bar{b}\phi$.
The corresponding expected and observed $95\%$ $CL_s$ confidence level  limits are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:limit_xs}.
%The limits for production in association with b-quarks and via gluon fusion are shown separately.
Esclusion limits for additional bechmark scenario like $m_h^{max}$, tauphobic and light-stop scenarios are shown in Appendix~\ref{appendix:result}.
More information on the limit setting procedure and its validation can be found in Appendix~\ref{appendix:limit}.

\subsection{Combination with Other Search Channels}
The results of the presented search are combined with the search for neutral MSSM Higgs bosons in the semi-leptonic 
and fully hadronic $\tau\tau$ decay channels, which are characterized by the presence of one and two hadronically decaying 
$\tau$ leptons in the final state, respectively.
The search for the semi-leptonic decays  ($\tau_h \tau_{\ell}$) has a high sensitivity to the signal for a large mass range
and is split into two categories defined by the mass of the Higgs boson candidate: 
a low-mass category optimized for $90 < m_{\phi} < 200$~GeV and a high-mass category for $200 < m_{\phi} < 1000$~GeV.
The $\tau_h \tau_{\ell}$ channel is combined with the $\tau_{\ell} \tau_{\ell}$ in the low-mass category  while  the high-mass category 
$\tau_h \tau_{\ell}$ is combined with the $\tau_h\tau_h$ channel. There is no simultaneous 
combination of the three search channels over the full mass range since it  is demonstrated to give no further 
improvement of the signal sensitivity. 
A comparison between the expected and observed limits obtained with the different search channels is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:comp1} in the $m_h^{max}$ scenario. 
Figure~\ref{fig:comball} shows the upper limit in the $m_h^{mod}$ scenario for the combination of all three search channel,  the vertical dashed line at 200~GeV 
indicates the transition point between low and high mass categories. 
The outcome of the search is also interpreted in a model-independent way by setting  limits
on the cross-section times branching ration into $\tau$ pairs of a scalar boson produced via
gluon fusion   or in association with b-quarks, the combined upper limits are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mhmod_all}.
A comparison with the corrispective CMS result~\cite{CMSLimit} is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:limitcomparisons} for the $m_h^{max}$ benchmark scenario,
ATLAS currently provide the world best limit for the neutral MSSM Higgs boson search for  $m_A>600$~GeV.
Exclusion limits obtained for other  benchmark scenarios can be found in Appendix~\ref{appendix:result}.
